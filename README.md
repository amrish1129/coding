# coding
Project  for improving coding skills. 
Step 1: Start with easiest and quickest solution.
Step 2: Workout on Time and Space Complexity.
Step 3: Think of ways to improve it.
  Ask 3 questions:
  a) Can I Re-encode the input to optimize time and space complexity.
  b) Can I use a better Datastrcuture
  c) Can I fit the problem in a common design paradigm. Like Divide and Conquer, Greedy and so on.
